A JavaScript **closure** is formed when you define a function within a function. The inner function "closes over", "captures", or "remembers" the variables of the outer function even though it finished executing.

**Here's an example**:
```javascript
function outerFunction() {

  const outerFunctionVariable = `the outer function's data`;

  function innerFunction() {
      console.log(`The inner function can remember ${outerFunctionVariable} even after the outer function is done executing!`);
  }

  innerFunction();
}

outerFunction();
```
**Output**:
```bash
The inner function can remember the outer function's data even after the outer function is done executing!
```

Apparently, there's many usecases for closures which we'll get into next.

Some use cases for closures to explore on our next dive into JavaScript closures can include:

- Data Encapsulation and Privacy
- Function Factories
- Callback Functions
- Event Handlers
- Memoization
- Partial Application and Currying
- Module Pattern
- Timeouts and Intervals
- Asynchronous Programming
- Emulating Private Methods
- Managing State in Iterators
- Event Handling in React or UI Frameworks
- Creating Memoized Functions
- Handling Asynchronous Flows with Promises
- Singleton Pattern
- Dynamic Function Generation
- Custom Callback and Filters
- Debouncing and Throttling

See you next time!
